Further Exercises
=================

The Mutillidae application is a rich source of vulnerabilities to try to 
exploit.  When you have completed the other exercises, some suggestions
for other things to try are:

- Use the SQLMap application to perform an automated SQL injection attack
  on the application.  The application is installed in the "sqlmap" directory
  and its web site is at http://www.sqlmap.org. You will need Python 2.x
  in order to run SQLMap.

  The User Info page is a good place to start: 
     http://ipaddr:port/index.php?page=user-info.php

  Start with an SQLMap command like this:

  C:> python sqlmap.py -u http://192.168.56.101:9000/index.php?page=user-info.php 
      --dbms=mysql

  Full usage instructions are in the user manual:
