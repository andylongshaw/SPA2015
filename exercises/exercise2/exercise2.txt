Exercise 2
==========

1. Having managed an exploit for the database, can we get access to the 
   operating system?  Navigate to the DNS Lookup page and use it to look up
   an IP address.  (Note depending on your VM network options you might
   just get an error - this is fine we don't need to use the IP addresses).

   Now, if you look at the output, what can you tell from it?  What is 
   the server side script probably doing?  Can you use this knowledge to
   find the current working directory of the server process?  Can you
   list its content?

2. TODO - upload PHP file and inject into the web site (possibly gaining root access!)
